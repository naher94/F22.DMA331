Prototype can help you answer meaningful user questions throughout the design process from paper prototypes to high fidelity very polished prototypes that mimic the experience of the final product. It can play a big role in helping your users understand your product and evaluate it during user testing, in a way letting them get hands-on with a preview of whats to come. These prototype may include interaction details things like hover effects and motion. We will be focusing on these higher-fidelity interactions and the role of motion in your designs.
