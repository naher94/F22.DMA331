As we wrap up the semester today we will also have a special guest Lindsey Dufour:

Lindsey Dufour is a product designer with a background in visual and interaction design. She has had a wide range of experiences designing for both physical and digital products. She has been working for GE HealthCare since 2017 and has over 13 years experience in design. 

During her career, she has had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of products and multiple facets of design. She spearheaded the research, design, and implementation of a clinical imaging mobile experience. She traveled to Asia to conduct on-site interviews with users in multiple countries. She has been recognized as a top innovator within GE HealthCare and has participated in or led several innovation and design sprint workshops. She was the UX design lead for a product focused on streamlining radiology workflows during a major product transformation that included a complete redesign of the application, an improved workflow experience, and new medical device status. 

Her design super powers include detailed design, rapid prototyping, exploring multiple solutions to a problem, and hands-on collaboration, which are well suited for her current role as the Design Lead within the Edison Design System. Her focus is on evolving the system to fit the needs of the consuming applications and ensuring design consistency both within the system itself and the consuming application teams. She loves that a design system empowers other designers to work more efficiently and believes that the little details make a big difference in the overall user experience.
