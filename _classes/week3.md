Responsive design or responsive web design is a design approach that looks at making web pages render nicely across a variety of device and window sizes. Think sites that look and feel right on both your phone and a desktop browser.

More recently content and performance consideration have been added to the definition of responsive design. A content consideration might been referencing the device by name: "Our product works great on smartphones" vs "Our product was built for the web". Performance considerations might include loading smaller images or reducing load time of a site, due to higher use of mobile networks.

* Mobile Web vs Mobile Native considerations
* Breakpoints
* Click targets
* Accessibility -->
