A user experience audit is the process of identifying potential areas for usability improvements based on established heuristics and/or prior research. In this case we will be using the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). UX audits also aim to capture areas of a workflow that well execute established heuristics.

For example, an audit of an e-commerce checkout process may reveal that it is overly complex, and it offers limited payment options but clearly informs the users where in the process they are.

An effective UX audit targets issues to ultimately create an easier and more seamless user journey. This process can help to increase customer engagement and user satisfaction helping to delivery on the business goals.

Document in Figma a UX audit of the following sites and scenarios across their desktop and mobile web experiences:
* [Weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov)
	* Looking up the weather overview for Pittsburgh
	* Reviewing hourly for the next day
* [Royal Mansour](https://www.royalmansour.com/en/)
	* Exploring the amenities and rooms
	* Booking a stay in December
* [Noodlehead](http://noodleheadpgh.com)
	* Exploring the menu and getting their location
	* Placing an online order

Create a new file for your assignment in the "UX Audit" Figma project following a similar format of the [template.](https://www.figma.com/file/47GeOsq7eD0acRt4N9esHU/DMA331---UX-Audit-Template?node-id=0%3A1)([.fig](/documents/ux-audit-template.fig)) Also make sure that the file name starts with your name.

| | Usability Heuristics | Mental Modeling / Workflow |
| --- | ----------- | ---- |
| | 40 points | 20 points |
| 100% | Notes several instances of each heuristics in both mobile and desktop | Notes detailed user pain points and positive steps in the workflow and user's mindset for the respective scenarios |
| 80% | Notes several instances of each heuristic across mobile and desktop | Notes detailed user pain points and positive steps in the workflow or user's mindset for the respective scenarios |
| 60% | Notes 1 instance of each heuristic | Notes pain points and positive steps in the workflow or the user's mindset |
| 40% | Notes at least half of the heuristics | Notes some pain points and positive steps in the workflow or the user's mindset |
