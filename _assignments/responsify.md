Based on comments from your audit and other best practices re-design the [Noodlehead](http://noodleheadpgh.com) site. Think about mobile users and desktop users, specific user workflows such as exploring the menu and getting their location and placing an online order.

Show the process through comments, questions, screenshots, inspiration, doodles etc. If you need help with picking a method feel free to leverage the [Human-Centered Design Handbook](https://www.designkit.org/methods)

## Logistics

Document this assignment in Figma with 1 [page](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038511293-Create-and-manage-pages) for the final design proposal and 1 page for all your working thoughts and ideas.

My recommendation on device/frame size is to use the Figma's Macbook Pro (1440 x 900) for your desktop layout and Figma's iPhone 11 Pro / X (375 x 812) for your mobile designs.

## Grading Rubric
